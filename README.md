# Image Download Speed Test

The Image Download Speed Test is a simple JavaScript-based project that measures the download speed of images from a specified URL. It utilizes the Fetch API and JavaScript's `Image` object to download images and calculate their download speeds.

deployed at https://detect-internet-project.netlify.app

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to:

1. Download images from a given source (in this case, the source.unsplash.com API).
2. Measure the time it takes to download an image.
3. Calculate and display the average download speeds in bits per second (bps), kilobits per second (Kbps), and megabits per second (Mbps) after a specified number of test downloads.

## Features

- Downloads random images from unsplash.com.
- Measures the time taken to download each image.
- Calculates and displays average download speeds in bps, Kbps, and Mbps.
- Conducts multiple tests to obtain more accurate results.
- Provides real-time feedback on the progress of the tests.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your computer.
2. Open the HTML file in your web browser.
3. The tests will automatically start when the web page loads, and you will see real-time progress updates in your browser.

## Usage

1. Open the project in your web browser at https://detect-internet-project.netlify.app.
2. The tests will run automatically, downloading random images and measuring download speeds.
3. The average speeds in bps, Kbps, and Mbps will be displayed after all tests are completed.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Fetch API
- HTML

## Acknowledgments

- This project was created as an educational exercise to demonstrate image download speed measurement in JavaScript.

## Disclaimer

This project uses random images from unsplash.com, which may be subject to changes or restrictions over time. The results of download speed tests may vary depending on the internet connection and external factors. The project is intended for educational purposes and not for production use.
